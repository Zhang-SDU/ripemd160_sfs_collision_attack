# ripemd160_sfs_collision_attack

This project primarily demonstrates the differential probability enhancing framework for SFS collision attacks on RIPEMD-160.

The 'automated_trail_search' folder contains the codes for searching for left branch and right branch differential characteristics.

The 'data_test_cluster' folder contains the codes for testing the differential clustering effect in last steps of right branch.

The 'attacks_time_complexity' folder contains the codes for computing the time complexities for 41/42/43/44/48-step SFS collision attacks.

The 'verify_collision' folder contains the codes used to verify the validity of our collsion message pairs.
